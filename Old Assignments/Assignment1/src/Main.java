/**
 * PART C: Discussion
 *
 * 1:
 * Right now, the program only passes the total number of weak spots from Part A to Part B,
 * but it doesnâ€™t make full use of the data.
 * A better approach would be to save the exact coordinates of the weak spots found in Part A and then reuse those in Part B.
 * This would make the process more efficient by avoiding redundant checks.
 *
 * 2:
 * Right now the algorithm uses an offset array to check in its 8 neighbors, up, down, left, right, and diagonals.
 * For each neighbor the algorithm checks if the value is divisible by 10. if any neighbor meets this condition, the weakspot is classified as a crack
